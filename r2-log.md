# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 2 - Clay Reber

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [December 1st, Monday, 2020].

## Log

### R2D1 
Started a Sudoku Solver. Had help from Youtube:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_UYXzGuqvM. Coded a function which can tell if a supposed entry in a Sudoky puzzle is possible.

### R2D2 (12/2/20)
Finished the Sudoky Solver. It was really fun and I might play with said file another time to better understand the recursion process. Guy in video proposed a project idea of a puzzle from his childhood (example: https://www.schoolarchimedes.com/klotski). I might revisit this project idea in time. 

Started tutorial on how to use Docker. Since I often switch between using my laptop and desktop, I consider this a prime opportinity to get more frequent with preserving development environments in an efficient mannter. Tutorial can be found here: https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/. I'll apply a Docker file to my previous Sudoku project once I have the hang of it.

ALSO, almost forgot, but added development branch to my repository. I will be posting my in-progress stuff there from now on. 

### R2D3 (12/3/20)
Finished the tutorial on docker-compose. I was able to host my own container for a page that incremented whenever refreshed. Saw cool things such as how to change text within the container without deleting data which was already created (it kept counting from where I left off). I have a feeling I have a lot farther to go before I can easily implement it to more complex projects, but who knows.

Currently stuck deciding on what to do tomorrow. I could code side-by-side with this video to better understand Flutter: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBKzpTz65Io. Or I could work on learning how to solve that wierd-ass puzzle I linked yesterday on my own. I could go back to making my personal website I started six months ago. Or I could even go back to programming that Starcraft bot. I really don't know yet. Flutter would be most practical, but I need to remind myself I am working on this OUTSIDE of work and not accidentally make a chore out of it. I really dont know.

### R2D4 (12/4/20)

I was completely lost on what to do for a project today. I accidently broke Flutter this morning, and it is taking longer than usual to reset the development environment. 

I wanted to make sure I at least did something today, so I said "What the hell" and went back to making my Starcraft bot. 

The API i once used seems to have changed a bit ( https://github.com/BurnySc2/python-sc2), so I'm going to rewrite my code from scratch again. Will be using this outdated guide for reference as an idea of where to start: https://pythonprogramming.net/starcraft-ii-ai-python-sc2-tutorial//. 

But most importantly, I WAS SOMEHOW ABLE TO SET UP THE API AND GET A DEMO RUNNING IN LESS THAN HALF AN HOUR. HOW THE HELL WAS THAT SO EASY. Maybe I'm finally getting better at setting stuff up. Or maybe I was just lucky. Who knows. 

### R2D5 (12/5/20)

Back to the SC2 bot. Might fix flutter today so I can have multiple projects to bounce off of. 

A noticable change from last time I tried this project is how much I'm actually researching the documentation before coding anything. Previously, I would just try to copy Sentdex's work (youtube linked above), and just try to replace his outdated methods with pasted methods from other examples I saw in the python-sc2 repository. This is a good sign of me getting more familiar with code. 

I might come back to this later tonight, so it is possible there might be 2 'R2D5' commits in my repo. I don't know if this will be considered bad practice but oh well.
