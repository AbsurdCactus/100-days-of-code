## Log

### R2D1 
Started a Sudoku Solver. Had help from Youtube:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_UYXzGuqvM. Coded a function which can tell if a supposed entry in a Sudoky puzzle is possible.

### R2D2 (12/2/20)
Finished the Sudoky Solver. It was really fun and I might play with said file another time to better understand the recursion process. Guy in video proposed a project idea of a puzzle from his childhood (example: https://www.schoolarchimedes.com/klotski). I might revisit this project idea in time. 

Started tutorial on how to use Docker. Since I often switch between using my laptop and desktop, I consider this a prime opportinity to get more frequent with preserving development environments in an efficient mannter. Tutorial can be found here: https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/. I'll apply a Docker file to my previous Sudoku project once I have the hang of it.

ALSO, almost forgot, but added development branch to my repository. I will be posting my in-progress stuff there from now on.
