### R4D1 (12/16/20)

Debated wether to start this again during Finals week but honestly this felt like a much needed break between tests. 

Started work on learning how to solve a Klotski puzzle (example of said puzzle here: https://www.schoolarchimedes.com/klotski). Was about to google how to make a klotski puzzle so I could start working on the solving algorithim instantly, but decided against it. This projects seems simple enough to be a prime opportunity to mess with UnitTests and TDD. 

So I spent most of the hour making basic UnitTests in Python. Now I am starting to write my first tests for the board. Current task is seeing how to check if a method exists in a project (which my tired brain just realized is a stupid thing to do).


### R4D2 (12/17/2020)

Today was really fun. It was purely a day getting reaquanted with running tests. It took so long just to figure out how to get a basic function and variable to pass the suite. But holy shit it felt good to get them to pass! TO be fair, I was only passing integers, so I know it will be eons harder to learn how to test a game board. But I can already feel the benefits of running tests before writing any code. I may have a simple function that only values a single integer, but I can tell running these tests will help compartmentalize this project into smaller chunks which will be much easier for me to handle. 

Tomorrow I plan to figure out how I intend to create the game board for Klotski. I first intended it to be just a matrix, but who knows. Maybe TDD will help me see something I'm missing. Perhaps I should focus on creating individual blocks first before I create the board? I had never thought of that until now.
