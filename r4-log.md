### R4D1 (12/16/20)

Debated wether to start this again during Finals week but honestly this felt like a much needed break between tests. 

Started work on learning how to solve a Klotski puzzle (example of said puzzle here: https://www.schoolarchimedes.com/klotski). Was about to google how to make a klotski puzzle so I could start working on the solving algorithim instantly, but decided against it. This projects seems simple enough to be a prime opportunity to mess with UnitTests and TDD. 

So I spent most of the hour making basic UnitTests in Python. Now I am starting to write my first tests for the board. Current task is seeing how to check if a method exists in a project (which my tired brain just realized is a stupid thing to do).
