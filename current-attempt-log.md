# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## MY CURRENT ATTEMPT AT STRICTLY PLAYING #100DaysOfCode

### Day 1: December 28th, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Restarted my challenge. Did some FreeCodeCamp. Restructured my repo files and added old files from my previous attempts. 

**Thoughts** Some blogs mention how it's sometimes okay to go lax on the challenge rules, but I'm genuinely curious as to if I can follow this challenge by the book. Besides, it not like I'm deleting the work of my previous attempts. 

I can't necessarily write my own unit tests on HTML (at least not yet), but I been doing my best at following TDD principles where I can. I run my code through a validator to make sure it has correct syntax, and make the effor to do red/green/refractor with each individual test on the site. It's definitely showing a change: my code for each individual submission is a lot smaller and specific for each challenge than it would be if I had just used the same file to submit all my stuff. 

Might touch my Klotski or SC2 game tomorrow. I'm not sure yet. I'm having a lot of fun with freecodecamp so far.
